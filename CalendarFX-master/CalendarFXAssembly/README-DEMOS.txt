This directory contains several demo applications to showcase some of 
the capabilities of CalendarFX. Each demo can be started by double clicking
on the file. If this does not work, then go to the command line and start
the applications via the following command:

	java -jar xyz.jar
	
-- calendar-demo.jar

	This demo is a proof of concept and basically reimplements the calendar
	application of MacOS X.
		
-- sampler-demo.jar

	This is a sampler application where each sample listed on the left-hand
	side focuses on one or more specific features of CalendarFX. It is 
	great for testing the framework but also for getting an idea which 
	features are available. 

-- google-demo.jar

	This application is a rich-client for the Google calendar. You need to have
	a Google account to use it.

-- weather-demo.jar

	A small demo of the MonthSheetView control showing how the cells can be
	customized.

-- ical-demo.jar

	This application loads several web-based iCal calendars and displays them.
	The user can interact with the entries but changes will not be written
	back to any server. This application is intended as a stress-test for
	CalendarFX development purposes but also shows how easy it is to display
	calendars based on the industry standard iCal.
	
If you have any questions related to these demos please feel free to submit
a question in the CalendarFX forum at dlsc.com
